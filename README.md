# WordsearchSolver

This was my final project for CSC270.  It solves an NxN square wordsearch, given a valid puzzle and a list of words. 

# Usage

The program requires two arguments, a puzzle and a list of words to search for.  Current implementation requires changing a constant if you want to use puzzles that are of a size other than 10.


Consider checking my partners project @ https://github.com/danielbarbarito/Word-Search-Generator
